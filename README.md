## Comlib (work in progress üë∑ üõ†Ô∏è)

Comlib is a system that aims to complement your reading habits. You log on to the system track what you're reading, share reading materials with others and even set milestones.

#### Android development

Comlib attempts use of the latest libraries and tools:

- Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  
- Ui is completely written in [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
  
- Uses [Hilt]() for Dependency Injection.
  
- Uses [Recommended architecture]([Recommendations for Android architecture &nbsp;|&nbsp; Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations)) and Architectural components - Room, Lifecycle, Navigation throughout.
  

#### Development setup

You need to be using the latest Android studio (Hedgehog and newer) to build and run the app.

#### Code style

Comlib employs the use of [Gradle conventional plugins](https://medium.com/@yudistirosaputro/gradle-convention-plugins-a-powerful-tool-for-reusing-build-configuration-ba2b250d9063#:~:text=Gradle%20convention%20plugins%20are%20a,build%20management%20and%20increase%20efficiency.) for faster and efficient build times

The default Android linter is used to catch bugs before they propagate in production.
