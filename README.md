Comlib is a system that aims to complement your reading habits. You log on to the system track what you're reading, share reading materials with others and even set milestones.

#### Problem statement

The modern society requires individuals to stay constantly updated on various aspects of the world. The exchange of ideas, beliefs, and opinions is happening at a rapid pace. Young people need to be consistently aware of what is happening in the world around them.

Reading is one of the proven ways to enhance the exchange of information, especially in a world where information is ubiquitous. Establishing a strong foundation in the principles that shape our lives is an effective way to promote this exchange. But how do we ensure that we regularly update ourselves without the need to purchase books every time, which can be both expensive and time-consuming?

Enter **ComLib**. We strive to simplify the process of book exchange for readers, effectively fostering the development of a reading culture.

#### Android development

Comlib attempts use of the latest libraries and tools:

- Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

- Ui is completely written in [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

- Uses [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for Dependency Injection.

- Uses [Recommended architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations) and Architectural components - Room, Lifecycle, Navigation throughout.

#### Development setup

You need to be using the latest Android studio (Hedgehog and newer) to build and run the app.

#### Code style

Comlib employs the use of [Gradle conventional plugins](https://medium.com/@yudistirosaputro/gradle-convention-plugins-a-powerful-tool-for-reusing-build-configuration-ba2b250d9063#:~:text=Gradle%20convention%20plugins%20are%20a,build%20management%20and%20increase%20efficiency.) for faster and efficient build times.

### Linting

ComLib uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) and [Ktlint](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) is used to catch bugs before they propagate in production.
